Here I demonstrate the use of callbacks or promises to solve the following problem:

```
A set of URLs is given in an array.

Write JavaScript that retrieves all of the URLs, and then executes a something when all URLS are loaded.
```

To run just copy the code from one of the files and paste in the chrome developer tools console and run from there.
